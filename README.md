Sentiment Analysis Project
This repository contains a sentiment analysis project implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal of the project is to classify the sentiment of movie reviews from the IMDb dataset as either positive or negative using a Logistic Regression model.

Overview
This project demonstrates how to preprocess text data, transform it into TF-IDF features, and train a Logistic Regression model for sentiment analysis. The project also includes steps to save and load the trained model using pickle for future predictions.

Dataset
The project uses the IMDb dataset, which contains movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. The dataset can be downloaded from here.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
NLTK
Pickle
Installation
Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-project.git
cd sentiment-analysis-project
Install the required packages:

sh
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk
Download the NLTK stopwords:

sh
Copy code
python -m nltk.downloader stopwords
Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

sh
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.

Model Training
The model training process includes the following steps:

Loading the Dataset: The IMDb dataset is loaded using Pandas.
Text Preprocessing: The text data is transformed into TF-IDF features using TfidfVectorizer.
Model Training: A Logistic Regression model is trained using LogisticRegressionCV with cross-validation.
Model Saving: The trained model is saved using Pickle for future use.
Prediction
To predict the sentiment of new text data:

Define the preprocess_and_predict function to transform new texts and make predictions using the saved model.
Use the preprocess_and_predict function to predict the sentiment of new reviews.
python
Copy code
def preprocess_and_predict(new_texts):
    new_texts_tfidf = tfidf.transform(new_texts)
    predictions = saved_clf.predict(new_texts_tfidf)
    return predictions

new_texts = ["It was perfect, perfect , down to the last minute details", "It is waste of money"]
predictions = preprocess_and_predict(new_texts)
print(f"Predictions: {predictions}")
